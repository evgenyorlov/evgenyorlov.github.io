My name is Evgeny Orlov. I am a machine learning engineer with more than 7 years of experience currently living in Moscow, Russia. The thing I like about the job the most is building ML-services that have a large impact on the users. Most Recently, I worked with a computer vision team on building a large pipeline to automatically extract and validate data from the document images using deep learning techniques. I've always wanted to experience working in multinational team in an English speaking environment. So at the moment I'm looking for a new challenging job opportunity outside Russia. I would prefer to relocate in Europe but also open to remote work.

My one-page resume is available [here](/resume).
