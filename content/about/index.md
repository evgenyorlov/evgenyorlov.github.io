I'm Evgeny Orlov, a machine learning engineer from Moscow, Russia.

For the last 6 years, I've been working on bringing machine learning into production. Most recently, I worked for the largest Russian mortgage processing [company](https://domclick.ru) on applying deep learning to automate data capture from document images.

I am currently searching for a new challenge in my career.

My one-page resume is available [here](/resume).
